{"json-result":{"count":8,"items":[{"newsid":"177","newstext":"We have implemented a new feature allowing freelancers, when bidding on a project, to specify the required initial milestone percentage. For example, if you specify a 50% milestone percentage, this means you require the employer to create a 50% milestone payment before you start work on the project.\r\n\r\nMilestone payments are a great way to create trust between a freelancer and an employer, and are designed to protect both parties. We recommend freelancers specify a milestone percentage for your bids, especially if you are bidding on large projects. Milestone payments protect employers since the money is not released to the freelancer until they complete the work, and the employer is happy with the job\r\nthey have done.\r\n\r\nThe system does not automatically create the milestone\r\npayment when the project starts. The employer will need to create the agreed milestone once the bid is accepted by both parties. The milestone percentage succinctly shows the terms of engagement the freelancer is looking for."},{"newsid":"176","newstext":"<br>\r\n<h2>FreelancerAPI in New Scientist<\/h2>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.newscientist.com\/article\/mg20627595.300-become-a-wage-slave-to-software.html\">Read the article here<\/a>."},{"newsid":"175","newstext":"<br>  <h2>Add your education details and awards to your profile now!<\/h2>  <br>  You can now add your education history, awards you've won or licenses you hold to your profile.
